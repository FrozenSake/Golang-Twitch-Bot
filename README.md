# Golang-Twitch-Bot

# STABLE_LOCAL

This is the version that was running stably and correctly on my local PC, and could be run alongside a stream. In preparation for a complete re-write, this branch was created to preserve a working copy.

# Environment Variables
This bot uses a few environment variables currently. Create a file called ".env" in the root directory. You can rename the "example.env" file.

Then, load it up with:

oauth=[OUATH KEY]

username=[BOT USERNAME]

channels=[COMMA SEPERATED CHANNELS TO JOIN]

clientID=[CLIENT ID FROM TWITCH API]

clientSecret=[CLIENT SECRET FROM TWITCH API]
